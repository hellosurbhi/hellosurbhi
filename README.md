## Hello world <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> I'm [Surbhi](https://www.surbhi.dev/)
</h2>

**JS | React | Redux | Node | Express | HTML5 | CSS | Typescript | Python**

I love the idea of creating visually appealing, intuitive products that everybody from one's parents to their children can use with ease. 

I've created and shipped dynamic websites from scratch and adept at writing clean, modularised code with unit tests. 

I'm well versed in Algorithms and Data Structures and use the principles I learnt as part of my CS degree at Goucher College to ensure the highest efficiency in my work.

In my free time, I like to automate boring tasks with Selenium and Puppeteer. 

I'm also a voracious reader and enjoy curling up with a good book. I'm currently re-reading Cat's Cradle for the nth time!

Skills: 
Vanilla JS, MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node), UI Automation Testing
