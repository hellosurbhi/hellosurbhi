## hey, i'm surbhi 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** with 7+ years building products that serve millions of people. I've been the 4th engineer at a computer vision startup and am currently leading a distributed team shipping e-commerce experiences at scale. I care deeply about craft, clean architecture, and making software that your parents could use without calling you for help.

I have a double major in **Computer Science & English**, and I believe the best engineers are also great communicators. The best code reads like good prose: clear, intentional, and with no unnecessary words.

Currently building **30 AI-powered micro-apps in 30 days** to see what happens when you pair curiosity with an API and a deadline.

### 🧠 things i think about

`accessible design` · `component architecture` · `making APIs that don't make you cry` · `why standups should be async` · `building in public` · `how to explain technical debt to non-engineers using food metaphors` · `automation as self-care`

### 📚 outside the editor

I'm a voracious reader (currently on my nth reread of Cat's Cradle). I automate boring things for fun — if I have to do something twice, the third time a script does it. I think a lot about how to make technical concepts accessible to non-technical people, which is probably the English major's fault.
